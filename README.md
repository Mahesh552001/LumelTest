I'm using the Zoho Catalyst Serverless Platform to run this application. Then I have hosted the application, here is the link - https://lumelappsail-30011105496.development.catalystappsail.eu

For an easier go, I'm sharing the credentials of the account. You can sign in to the console with the below credential.

After login, you can get into the **'Cloud Scale'** service. Inside that you can find the **DataStore** and **FileStore**

1. I'm using the CSV file from the filestore, So for newer CSV files, you have to upload the CSV file to the folder 'MyCSV' and note down the ID.

    **Load** -  https://lumelappsail-30011105496.development.catalystappsail.eu/load?fileId=1755000000020378 (If you need to load a different CSV file, first upload it in the filestore and modify the ID here in the URL)
